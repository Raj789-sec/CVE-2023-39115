Login: An authenticated attacker with valid credentials logs into the Campcodes Online Matrimonial website admin panel.
Navigate to Vulnerable Directory: The attacker navigates to the /profile-settings directory, which is accessible to administrators for configuring profile settings.
Access Image Gallery: Within the /profile-settings section, the attacker clicks on the "Gallery" option, which is intended to manage user profile images.
Upload SVG File: The attacker selects the "Add New Image" option and proceeds to upload an SVG file. They click on "Browser" and then "Add Files" to select the SVG file from their local system.
Upload Malicious SVG: The attacker chooses an SVG file that contains carefully crafted malicious code, designed to exploit the vulnerability when the SVG is processed by the application.
Trigger Payload: After successfully uploading the malicious SVG file, the attacker clicks on the uploaded image. This action triggers the payload contained within the SVG file, which could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
